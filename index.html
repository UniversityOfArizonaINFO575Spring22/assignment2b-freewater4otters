            When there is a lull between, work, social, and general obligations, there is a certain
            activity that is both distracting and challenging to occupy the quiet moment of freedom. This, of course,
            are tabletop games, board games, cards games, whatever you may refer to popular stables like
            <i>Operation</i> or the gut-wrenching <i>Monopoly</i>. <i>PARKS, TRAILS, AND MORE</i> is an ode to
            this beloved pass time, and it will showcase some of my favorite games, including the peaceful and beautifully
            created <i>Parks</i> and <i>Trails</i>, a game designed around the United States National Parks featuring
            various artist interpretations of these worldly landscapes.
